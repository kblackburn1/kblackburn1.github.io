						<p>Kayla Blackburn is a singer-songwriter and an experienced Audio Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in higher education and the music industry. She is an art and design professional with a Bachelor's degree focused in Music Production & Engineering from Berklee College of Music. She currently works in the Greater Boston area at Plaid Dog Recording, Boston Conservatory, and Club Passim. She also is a freelance recording, mixing and mastering engineer. She has engineered for artists such as Keyon Harold, Steve Chandy, The Q Tip Bandits, and Syd Lane. When it comes to songwriting, she draws inspiration from songwriters like Patty Griffin and Tracy Chapman, with her folk-inspired songs that pull you in and remind you of the profound, yet painful human experience. When it comes to producing and engineering, her favorite niche to work in is pop-punk, reminiscent of what she grew up listening to. Her musical background prior to her audio education consists of songwriting and classical voice training. Her background as a vocalist has made her passionate about choral music and vocal production, exploring the intersection of choral arrangements and technology. Outside of music, Kayla is passionate about VR and storytelling. She is currently working on Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality projects for education as a sound designer and Unity developer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
