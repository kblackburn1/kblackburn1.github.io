# Final Project Reflections
-
I initially wanted to do a AR project, but with the time constraints of the semester I chose to do a website. I do hope to finish
this project up after the semester ends to compliment the VR project I have been working on.

## Approach
-
I sketched out a quick markup on paper of the general layout I wanted and found a template accordingly.
I reached out to a tutor and found this template from TemplatedCo. Then, I shaped the page around that with an about, portfolio, and rates page.

## Challenges
-
Building off of a complex CSS template was more of a challenge than I anticipated. I struggled to follow where certain elements were like colors and font sizes
depending on which section of the site it was on. I also could not upload large files to Github, so I had to work around and upload to YouTube. However, once I
received my first file size error, I had issues with commits and pushes and had to recreate the repository because I would continue to receive errors for files
that no longer existed.
